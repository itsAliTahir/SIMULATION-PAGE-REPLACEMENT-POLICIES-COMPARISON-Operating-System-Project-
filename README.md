**How To Run Flutter Web App**

To run a Flutter web app, you'll need to follow these general steps. Please note that these instructions assume you have already set up Flutter on your system. If you haven't, you can follow the installation guide on the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

1. **Check Flutter Version:**
   Ensure that you have a recent version of Flutter installed on your system. You can check your Flutter version by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

   Make sure Flutter is up-to-date to ensure compatibility with the latest features and improvements.

2. **Enable Web Support:**
   Ensure that you have enabled Flutter web support by running the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

3. **Create a Flutter Web Project:**
   If you haven't created a Flutter web project yet, use the following command to create a new one:

   ```bash
   flutter create my_web_app
   ```

   Replace "my_web_app" with the desired name of your project.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your current working directory to the newly created project:

   ```bash
   cd my_web_app
   ```

   Replace "my_web_app" with the name of your project.

5. **Run the Flutter Web App:**
   Launch your Flutter web app using the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter run -d web
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open your web app in a default web browser. The `-d web` flag specifies that you want to run the app on the web platform.

6. **Access the App:**
   Once the build process is complete, you should see a message indicating the URL where your app is running (typically http://localhost:web-port/). Open this URL in your web browser to access and interact with your Flutter web app.

7. **Hot Reload:**
   Take advantage of Flutter's hot reload feature to quickly see changes in your code. After making changes to your code, save the file, and Flutter will automatically update the running web app without restarting.

8. **Build for Deployment:**
   When you're ready to deploy your Flutter web app, use the following command to create a production-ready build:

   ```bash
   flutter build web
   ```

   The build artifacts will be located in the `build/web` directory.

Remember that these instructions are a general guide, and depending on your specific development environment, you may encounter additional configuration steps. Refer to the official Flutter documentation for the most up-to-date information: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web



**Introduction**

This project is a memory management simulator that allows users to visualize and understand the behavior of three different memory allocation algorithms: Best Fit, First Fit, and Worst Fit. The simulator is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.





**Features**

**Algorithm Simulation:** Choose between Best Fit, First Fit, and Worst Fit algorithms to observe how each one allocates and de-allocates memory blocks.

**Visual Representation:** The simulator provides a graphical representation of memory blocks, allocations, and de-allocations, making it easy to understand the algorithms' behavior.

**Interactive Interface:** Users can interact with the simulator, inputting different parameters such as memory block sizes, allocation requests, and de-allocations.




**Getting Started**

Clone the repository:
```html
git clone https://github.com/huza1ma018/Memory-Management.git
```
Open the project directory:

```html
cd Memory-Management
```
Open index.html in your web browser




**Usage**

Launch the simulator by opening the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Select the desired algorithm from the interface.

Input memory block sizes, allocation requests, and de-allocations.

Observe the graphical representation of memory management.




**Algorithms**

Best Fit: The Best Fit algorithm selects the smallest available memory block that fits the requested size.
First Fit: The First Fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the requested size.
Worst Fit: The Worst Fit algorithm allocates the largest available memory block for the requested size.
