**Introduction**

This project is a memory management simulator that allows users to visualize and understand the behavior of three different memory allocation algorithms: Best Fit, First Fit, and Worst Fit. The simulator is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.





**Features**

**Algorithm Simulation:** Choose between Best Fit, First Fit, and Worst Fit algorithms to observe how each one allocates and de-allocates memory blocks.

**Visual Representation:** The simulator provides a graphical representation of memory blocks, allocations, and de-allocations, making it easy to understand the algorithms' behavior.

**Interactive Interface:** Users can interact with the simulator, inputting different parameters such as memory block sizes, allocation requests, and de-allocations.




**Getting Started**

Clone the repository:
```html
git clone https://github.com/huza1ma018/Memory-Management.git
```
Open the project directory:

```html
cd Memory-Management
```
Open index.html in your web browser




**Usage**

Launch the simulator by opening the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Select the desired algorithm from the interface.

Input memory block sizes, allocation requests, and de-allocations.

Observe the graphical representation of memory management.




**Algorithms**

Best Fit: The Best Fit algorithm selects the smallest available memory block that fits the requested size.
First Fit: The First Fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the requested size.
Worst Fit: The Worst Fit algorithm allocates the largest available memory block for the requested size.
